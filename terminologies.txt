Query ( Get data from database or cache):
    It is query that is used to fetch data from the graphql database or apollo local cache.

Mutation ( Modify data or cache):
    It is simply any code that is not trying to read against the data.
    We can write against the data, update data , delete data.

Apollo helps us to store cache of local data so that we avoid fetching same data from database
multiple times.
